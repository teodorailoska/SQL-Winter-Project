# SQL-Winter-Project
An SQL project I've worked on for exercise.<br>We were asked to make an imitation of a bank system to design a database for Salary management for employees that work in this bank across the world.<br>
I've prepared a database, as requested, that will be used to store and manage basic information about the employee and additionally manage monthly salary for each employee.
